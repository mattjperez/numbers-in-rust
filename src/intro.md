# Intro

Hey everyone, welcome to my Numbers in Rust!

This is a one-stop-shop for all things numbers as they relate to Rust and includes foundational CS information when we think it would be helpful.
It is a living document and will continue to grow until it lives up to its goal.
If you would like to help, please feel free to contribute via Issues, Pull-Requests, and Discussions on the repo!
